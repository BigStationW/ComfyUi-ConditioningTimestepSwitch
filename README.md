# ComfyUi-ConditioningTimestepSwitch

A custom node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that allows temporal switching between prompts.

## ✨ Use case.

- Some models such as **Z-Image Turbo** exhibit low seed variance, meaning they generate very similar images even when the seed changes.

- This node starts the denoising process with an empty (or alternative) prompt and then switches to your desired prompt after a specified timestep **threshold**.

- By delaying the main prompt, you introduce more randomness early in the diffusion process, which can significantly improve output diversity.
